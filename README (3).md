Developed the **largest**, and **first real-field image (India)** plant disease dataset comprising **4,200** images of **Citrus**. The iamges are captured in field using commodity smartphones Samsung S23 in the month of November - December 2025, usually the temperature was varying from $20$ to $30$ degrees and humidity was varying from $20$ to $25$ percent. The images have three kinds of background: white, gray and sand. Some of the images have full tree images and some have multiple leaves and diseases.

**Introduction**

1. Plant diseases are a major cause of yield reduction in agriculture, leading to significant economic losses. Citrus crops, which constitute a primary global source of essential nutrients such as vitamin C, are particularly affected, as citrus diseases severely degrade both fruit quality and overall production.

2. Computer vision and image processing techniques have been extensively employed for the automated detection and classification of plant diseases, offering effective and scalable solutions for precision agriculture.

3. The proposed dataset comprises images of both healthy and diseased citrus fruits and leaves, intended to support research on disease prevention and diagnosis using advanced computer vision–based approaches. The dataset includes samples affected by Greening, Anthracnose, Black Spot, Kenkar, Nutrient Deficiency, and Mold diseases.

4. The dataset contains a total of **4,200** images encompassing both citrus fruits and leaves, representing healthy and diseased conditions. Each image has a spatial resolution of varying from $4000$ pixels to $6000$ pixels, with a resolution of $72$ dpi.

5. All images were acquired in the Durgapura region, a tropical agricultural zone in Jaipur, Rajasthan, under the supervision of Dr. Pratibha Singh, Junior Soil Scientist, affiliated with the, Rajasthan Agriculture Research Institute (RARI), Jaipur.

5. Manual annotation of all images was performed by the Research scholars: Sagar Mal Mitharwal and Anand Kumar Jain, under the supervision of domain expert Dr. Pratibha Singh to ensure accurate class labeling. The dataset includes $600$ fruit images categorized into Black Spot, Canker, Greening (Huanglongbing) and healthy class ($1015$ images), and about $450$ Anthracnose and $430$ Mold images caused by insect damage. Approximately, $3200$ leaf images categorized into Black Spot, Canker, Greening, Dieback, Mold, and healthy classes.
